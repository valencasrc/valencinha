I am a Systems Analysis and Development student, fluent in English and a self-taught musician.
I was interested in the area of ​​technology because since I was a child I have always had contact with computers and video games and this opened my eyes to entering the world of algorithms. I started through a PowerApps course on Udemy and I improved and learned other languages like JavaScript, Python and style languages ​​like HTML and CSS.
Since June 2023, I have been working as a freelancer on some projects using Frontend and Web Developer knowledge.
